description: React Query integration and rules
globs: *.tsx, *.mdc, *.md
alwaysApply: false

### convention
For data fetching trpc query hook it should be:
`<feat>Query` or `userQuery`

- starts with the feature or entity name and ends with `Query`

For data mutation trpc query hook it should be:
`<feat>Mut` or `loginMut`

- starts with the feature or entity name and ends with `Mut`

---

if multiple trpc hooks is placed in one wrapper hook, it should be prefixed with `useMod`,example `useModUserSettings`

### rules

- Prefer `query.isPending` rather than `query.isLoading` when handling react-query for better type-guard support
- Prefer `mutation.mutateAsync` rather than `mutation.mutate`, handle the `mutateAsync` call with try-catch
- Do not export react-query hooks by destructuring its field, it should be the whole object
